            <p>The scam was the biggest money market scam ever committed in India, amounting to approximately ₹ 5,000
                crores. The main perpetrator of the scam was a stock and money market broker Harshad Mehta. It was a
                systematic stock scam using fake bank receipts and stamp paper that caused the Indian stock market to
                crash. The scam exposed the inherent loopholes of the Indian financial systems and resulted in a
                completely reformed system of stock transactions, including an introduction of online security
                systems.[1]<br>
                Security frauds refer to the idea of diversion of funds from the banking system to various stockholders
                or brokers.[2] The 1992 scam was a systematic fraud committed by Mehta in the Indian stock market which
                led to the complete collapse of security systems. He committed a scam of over 1 billion from the banking
                system to buy stocks on the Bombay Stock Exchange.[3] This impacted the entire exchange system as the
                security system collapsed and investors lost hundreds of thousands of rupees in the exchange system. The
                scope of the scam was so large that the net value of the stocks was higher than the combined health and
                education budget of India. The scam was orchestrated in such a way that Mehta secured securities from
                the State Bank of India against forged cheques signed by corrupt officials and failed to deliver the
                securities. Mehta made the prices of the stocks soar high through fictitious practices and sold the
                stocks that he owned in these companies.[4] The impact of the scam had many consequences, which included
                the losses incurred by lakhs of families and the immediate crash of the stock market. The index fell
                from 4500 to 2500 representing a loss of ₹ 1000 billion in market capitalization.[2] The 1992 scam
                raised many questions involving bank officials responsible for being in collusion with Mehta. An
                interview with Montek Singh Ahluwalia (Secretary, economic affairs at the Ministry of Finance) revealed
                that many top bank officials were involved.[5]</p>

            <header>Bank funds scam</header>
            <p>In the early 70's, banks in India were not allowed to invest in the equity markets. However, they were
                expected to post profits and to retain a certain ratio (threshold) of their assets in government fixed
                interest bonds. Mehta squeezed capital out of the banking system to address this requirement of banks
                and pumped this money into the share market. He promised the banks higher rates of interest, while
                asking them to transfer the money into his personal account, under the guise of buying securities for
                them from other banks. At that time, a bank had to go through a broker to buy securities and forward
                bonds from other banks. Mehta used this money temporarily in his account to buy shares, hike up demand
                of certain shares (such as that of ACC, Sterlite Industries, and Videocon) dramatically, sell them off,
                pass on a part of the proceeds to the bank and keep the rest for himself. This resulted in stocks like
                ACC, which was trading in 1991 for ₹200/share, catapult to nearly ₹9,000 in just 3 months.[6]</p>

            <header>Bank receipt scam</header>
            <p>Another major instrument was the bank receipt (BR). In a ready forward deal, securities were not moved
                back and forth in actuality. Instead, the borrower, i.e. the seller of securities, gave the buyer of the
                securities a BR. The BR serves as a receipt from the selling bank, and also promises that the buyer will
                receive the securities they have paid for at the end of the term. Having figured this out, Mehta needed
                banks, which could issue fake BRs, or BRs not backed by any government securities.<br>

                Once these fake BRs were issued, they were passed on to other banks and the banks in turn gave money to
                Mehta, plainly assuming that they were lending against government securities when this was not really
                the case.[7] He took the price of ACC from ₹200 to ₹9,000. That was an increase of 4,400%. Since he had
                to book profits in the end, the day he sold was the day when the markets crashed.[8][9]</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Ready_forward_deal_scam">
            <header>Ready forward deal scam</header>
            <p>The ready forward deal is a way where a single broker liaisons between two banks. When one bank wants to
                sell securities, it approaches the broker. This broker goes to another bank and tries to sell the
                securities and vice versa for buying. Since Mehta was a renowned broker, he got cheques issued in his
                name instead of the bank. When the bank wanted money for the securities, he approached another bank and
                repeated the same process, and invested the bank money in the stock market.[10] Mehta used the ready
                forward deal and applied it to the Bank Receipts system of the Indian financial systems. This system was
                the most flawed system as the Janakiraman Committee restructured the entire Bank Receipts system after
                the 1992 scam.[11]<br>

                Mehta used forged BR's to gain unsecured loans, and used several small banks to issue BRs on demand.
                Since these banks were small, Mehta held on to the receipts as long as he wanted. The cheques in favour
                of both the banks were credited into the brokers' accounts which was the account of Mehta. As a result,
                banks made heavy investments in BOK and MCB as they showed positive signs of growth.[1] Using the BR
                scam, Mehta took the price of ACC from ₹200 to ₹9000 in a short span of time. This 4400% percent
                increase was seen in several other stocks and as he sold the stocks, the market crashed.[8]<br>

                This went on as long as the stock prices kept going up, and no one had a clue about Mehta's operations.
                Once the scam was exposed, though, a lot of banks were left holding BRs which did not have any value –
                the banking system had been swindled of a whopping ₹4,000 crore (equivalent to ₹310 billion or US$3.8
                billion in 2023). They knew that they would be accused if their involvement in issuing cheques to Mehta
                was discovered. Subsequently, it transpired that Citibank, brokers like Pallav Sheth and Ajay Kayan,
                industrialists like Aditya Birla, Hemendra Kothari, a number of politicians, and the RBI Governor
                S.Venkitaramanan all had played a role in allowing or facilitating Mehta's rigging of the share
                market.[12]</p>

            <header>Realization of scam and market crash</header>
            <p>The scam first became apparent in late April 1992, when it became clear that Mehta was a
                disproportionately large investor in government securities. At the time, Mehta was doing more than a
                third of the total securities business in India. When the public realized that Mehta's investments were
                illegitimate and that his stocks were likely worthless, it set off a selling frenzy of Mehta's stocks.
                The banks that had loaned money to Mehta were suddenly holding hundreds of millions in unsecured loans.
                The combination of the selling frenzy and the fact that numerous banks been defrauded crashed the Indian
                stock market, with prices dropping 40% immediately.[13] Stocks eventually dropped 72%, and a bear market
                lasted for about 2 years.[14]</p><br>

            <header>Exposure trial and conviction</header>
            <p>Exploiting several loopholes in the banking system, Mehta and his associates siphoned off funds from
                inter-bank transactions and bought shares at a premium across many segments, triggering a rise in the
                BSE SENSEX. When the scheme was exposed, banks started demanding their money back, causing the collapse.
                He was later charged with 72 criminal offences, and more than 600 civil action suits were filed against
                him.[15]<br>

                He was arrested and banished from the stock market with investors holding him responsible for causing
                losses to various entities. Mehta and his brothers were arrested by the CBI on 9 November 1992 for
                allegedly misappropriating more than 2.8 million shares of about 90 companies through forged share
                transfer forms. The total value of the shares misappropriation was placed at ₹250 crore (equivalent to
                ₹19 billion or US$240 million in 2023).[16]<br>

                Mehta made a brief comeback as a stock market guru, giving tips on his own website as well as a weekly
                newspaper column. However, in September 1999, Bombay High Court convicted and sentenced him to five
                years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of ₹25,000 (US$310).[17] On 14 January 2003, The Supreme Court of
                India confirmed High Court's judgement in a 2–1 decision. While Justice B.N. Agrawal and Justice Arijit
                Pasayat upheld his conviction, Justice M.B. Shah voted to acquit him.[18]</p>

            <p>Mehta raised a furore on announcing that he had paid ₹10 million to the then Congress President and Prime
                Minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao, as a donation to the party, for getting him off the scandal case.[19][20]

                <header>Impacts</header>
                <p>The immediate impact was a drastic fall in share prices and market index, causing a breakdown of the
                    securities control system operation with the commercial banks and the RBI.[21] Around ₹35 billion
                    from the ₹2,500 billion market was withdrawn, causing the share market collapse. The Bombay Stock
                    shares resorted to records tampering in the trading system.[22] It caused panic with the public and
                    banks were severely impacted. Banks like Standard Chartered and ANZ Grindlays were implicated in the
                    scam for bank receipt forgery and transfer of money into Mehta's personal account. The government
                    realized that the fundamental problem with the financial structure of the stock markets was the lack
                    of computerized systems which impacted the whole stock market.[23]<br>

                    Various bank officers were investigated and implicated in fraudulent charges. The five main accused
                    officials were related to the Financial Fairgrowth Services Limited (FFSL) and Andhra Bank Financial
                    Services Ltd (ABFSL).[24] The chairman of Vijaya Bank committed suicide following the news about the
                    bank receipt scam. The scam led to the resignation of P. Chidambaram who was accused of owning shell
                    companies connected to Mehta. Mehta was convicted by the Bombay High Court and the Supreme Court of
                    India for his part in the financial scandal valued at ₹49.99 billion (US$740 million). Various bank
                    officials were arrested, leading to a complete breakdown of banking systems[25]</p>

                <header>Subsequent reforms</header>
                <p>The first reform was the formation of the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE). It was followed by
                    the development of the CII Code for Desirable Corporate Governance by Rahul Bajaj. The CII Code
                    commanded the formation of two major committees headed by Kumar Mangalam Birla and N. R. Narayana
                    Murthy, and overseen by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). The objective was to
                    monitor corporate governance and prevent future scams.[26] The SEBI were to monitor the NSE and the
                    National Securities Depository. For the equity market, the government introduced ten acts of
                    parliament and one constitutional amendment based upon the principles of economic reform and
                    legislative changes.[27] The introduction of online trading by NSE changed the dynamics of stock
                    buying and selling. The financial market opened up nationally rather than being confined to Bombay
                    (now, Mumbai).[1]</p>

                <p>The 1992 scam collapsed the Indian stock market; around 40% of the market value or ₹1,000 billion was
                    wiped out. It led the authorities to reconsider existing financial systems and restructure it. The
                    first structural change was to record payments made for purchasing investments in reconciled bank
                    receipts and subsidiary general ledgers to prevent fraudulent transactions. On the advice of the
                    Janakiraman Committee, a committee was established to oversee the Securities and Exchange Board of
                    India. The primary recommendation of the committee was to limit ready forward and double ready
                    forward deals to government securities only. All banks were made custodians rather than principals
                    in transactions. Banks were to have a separate audit system for portfolios, and it were to be
                    monitored by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).[11]</p>
